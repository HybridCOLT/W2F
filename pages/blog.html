                        In the Mortal Kombat series of fighting games, a Fatality is a special finishing move that can be used against one's opponent at the end of the final match. When the announcer says "Finish Him", or "Finish Her" if the opponent is female, the player can choose to kill him or her through a Fatality move. If input correctly, the background will darken, followed by the desired result.
